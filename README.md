Unofficial (and highly illegal) Python  API for Oddschecker


Plan to cover a few of the main sports but Racing and Football are only guarantees so far. Golf, Tennis, Greyhounds, Basketball, NFL etc could possibly follow if I don't get bored and if there is sufficient interest. Requests in discussions will be considered, briefly at least, and indeed at most.

<br>

## Requirements
Python 3.6 or greater is needed, you can get the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). In addition, the modules [lxml](https://lxml.de/), [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/), [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/) are needed. They can be installed using PIP(included with Python) with the following command.

` pip3 install lxml requests aiohttp`

<br>

## Install

Clone the repo with [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

`git clone https://github.com/4A47/liveodds.git`

or [download](https://github.com/4A47/liveodds/archive/main.zip) the zip.


<br>

## Usage
Documentation is possible in the future, in the meantime, most of the existing functionality will be shown in example files and here.

To use the API, copy the **inner** liveodds folder to your project. 

Only football and racing are confirmed thus far but this will be the style of import for any sport that gets covered.

```python
from liveodds.football import Football
from liveodds.racing import Racing
```

<br>

## Racing
There are 3 classes, **Racing**, **Meeting** and **Race**. The Racing class provides a few methods to assist in accessing Meeting objects which contain Race objects for each race at the meeting. Odds can be retrieved for the full meeting in the Meeting class or from individual races in the Race class.

### Meeting

**Meeting objects** contain information about a meeting and Race objects for each race at the meeting. They can be used to access the odds for every race at the meeting. They are stored in a nested dictionary in the Racing class and can be accessed using the convenience methods provided.

_Returns a specific meeting object_


#### Racing.meetings(date: str, region: str)

### Examples

Get meeting objects for today's racing in the UK and get a dictionary of odds for each meeting

```python
from liveodds.racing import Racing

racing = Racing()

today = racing.dates()[0]

for meeting in racing.meetings(today, 'UK'):
    odds = meeting.odds()
    print(meeting.course, odds)
```

<br>

The json method works in exactly the same way as odds but returns a JSON string as opposed to a dictionary.

```python
from liveodds.racing import Racing

racing = Racing()

today = racing.dates()[0]
region = racing.regions(today)[0]
course = racing.courses(today, region)[0]

meeting = racing.meeting(today, region, course)

print(meeting, meeting.json())
```

The JSON viewer shows the structure clearly

![json](https://i.postimg.cc/26WPXgqN/meeting-json.png)


<br>

Get a list of race objects from a meeting and print some information about them

```python
from liveodds.racing import Racing

racing = Racing()

today = racing.dates()[0]
course = racing.courses(today, 'UK')[0]
meeting = racing.meeting(today, 'UK', course)

for race in meeting.races():
    print(race.course, race.time, race.odds())
```
<br>

The Race.odds() method returns a dictionary where the key is the name of the horse, and the value is a dictionary of bookies odds

```python
from liveodds.racing import Racing

racing = Racing()

today = racing.dates()[0]
courses = racing.courses(today, 'UK')
meeting = racing.meeting(today, 'UK', courses[0])
race = meeting.race(meeting.times()[0])

race_odds = race.odds()

horse = race.horses()[0]

for bookie in race.bookies():
    print(f'{horse} - {bookie}: {race_odds[horse][bookie]}')

```
<br>

You can return a JSON string instead of a dictionary with the Race.json() method. A view of the json should make the structure clear.

#### Disclaimer
I hereby renounce all liability when the MI6 cybercrime net inevitably closes in on users of this API. If you do, in a moment of misguided recklessness, decide to use this API, you *will* go to jail, no ifs, buts or maybes, the cost of doing business here is hard time. So before you clone, ask yourself just how much you really want access to the latest odds in a python script, and is it worth throwing your life away for it? Would you torrent a car?
