"""
There are only 2 objects to care about - Meeting and Race

Meeting objects are stored in a nested dict in the Racing class.
Race objects are then retrieved from methods in Meeting class.

The underlying dict Racing._meetings can be accessed directly 
the structure is as follows:

        date: str
            region: str
                meeting: str
    
        meeting = racing._meetings[date][region][course]
    
    Example:
    
        meeting = racing._meetings['2021-03-05']['UK']['Newbury']
    

Or using some convenience functions

        meetings = racing.meetings(date, region)
            
        meeting = racing.meeting(date, region, course)
        
    Example:
    
        meetings = racing.meetings('2021-03-05', 'UK')
        
        meeting = racing.meeting('2021-03-05', 'UK', 'Newbury')
